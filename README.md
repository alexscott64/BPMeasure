# BPMeasure

This has been migrated to a simple js file. However, the java GUI remains here.

- BPMeasure is the main file (entry point)
- BPFrame has the GUI set including the inputs and the action performed logic
- BPCalculations has the algorithms used to calculate differences in BPM's and displays percentages

## This project uses Swing
